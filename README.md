This is a composer based installer for the [Drutopia distribution](http://www.drupal.org/project/drutopia).

# Prerequisites

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

It's just composer, isn't it awesome? :)

## Installation of Drutopia basic

```
composer create-project drutopia/drutopia_template:dev-master --no-interaction DIRECTORY
```

Composer will create a new directory called DIRECTORY (change to whatever presumably lower-case name you would like). Inside you will find the web directory with the entire code base of [Drutopia distribution](http://www.drupal.org/project/drutopia). You should be able to install it like any other Drupal site.
